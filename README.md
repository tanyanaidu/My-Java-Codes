# My-Java-Codes
In This Repository I'll be uploading all my java codes from my vocational Trainings. There are also some of projects like calculator and all. In this, JDBC Connectivity related codes are also present.
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.
